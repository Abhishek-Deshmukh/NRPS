Nginx Reverse Proxy Setter

It started just for reverse proxy but now you can do all static file handling as well

If you wondering if this is secure this uses a 2^7 bit security code to do anything.

It provides with a frontend to setup Nginx server.

Because the nginx confs are uglyðŸ¤¢

## Requirements

#### Build machine

Usually your laptop or desktop but can be the remote server itself

- NodeJS

#### Deployment machine

The remote server

- python3 (For reading and righting the nginx config)
- python3-pip (installing things for python)
- virtualenv (so that nrps does not mess up other things)
- nginx (duh â€¦)
- supervisor (to keep python running and restarting when it stops)
- certbot (for https)
- certbot-nginx (for https)

## How to Install and run

Follow [docs](http://deshmukh-blog.netlify.app/detail/6.html)

## Architecture

A flask api(backend) run as a root user, can read and write the nginx conf file, it gets requests form front end.

The fronend is a vue app, requests are send using axios.

Login authentication is done by flask
