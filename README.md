Nginx Reverse Proxy Setter

It started just for reverse proxy but now you can do all static file handling as well

If you wondering if this is secure this uses a 2^7 bit security code to do anything.

It provides with a frontend to setup Nginx server.

Because the nginx confs are uglyðŸ¤¢

## Architecture

A flask api(backend) run as a root user, can read and write the nginx conf file, it gets requests form front end.

The fronend is a vue app, requests are send using axios.

Login authentication is done by flask
